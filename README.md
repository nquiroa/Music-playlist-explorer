### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs, such as manipulating the DOM, event handling, and CSS styling, were very helpful in preparing me for the assignment. Specifically, I felt well-prepared for tasks like adding and deleting playlists and styling elements. However, I felt a bit unprepared when it came to implementing the search functionality, particularly with filtering playlists dynamically based on user input.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have added features such as sorting playlists by date and incorporating tags or categories for better organization. Additionally, I would refine the search functionality to handle edge cases, such as partial matches and case sensitivity.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During the project demo, the playlist creation and deletion features worked smoothly, and the hover effects on playlist cards were visually appealing. However, the transitions between different states of the application, such as opening and closing modals, felt abrupt and could have been smoother. I noticed that my peer's presentation had very smooth transitions and animations, which made their demo feel more polished, and I would like to incorporate similar smooth transitions in my future presentations.
